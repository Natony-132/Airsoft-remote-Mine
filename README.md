# Airsoft-remote-Mine
The Airsoft remote mine project is to create a device that can act as a simulated explosive (noise maker) to “tag” other airsoft players, without the operator needing to be in the direct area.

This project started as a time delay airsoft grenade. Due to the weight of the prototype, the project changed to a placeable sounding device. This idea became the Airsoft remote mine. 

After a few tests, a ramset nail gun cartridge was selected to make the loud sound needed to make it a mine. This requires a firing pin and a servo to trigger.

Version 1 consists of a single device with a remote detonator. It was made as a proof of concept and in game testing. 

Version 2 consists of a second device operating on a separate trigger code and a second handheld transmitter. Changes were made to the device that included a different power switch, a visible LED to show power, and a change to the firing pin. The V2 transmitter was changed to have a second rocker switch to allow the user to select the device that they intend to trigger. 

Version 2.5: During field play on multiple occasions, opposing players picked up or moved the device. To discourage this, a tamper switch was added to the V2 device. This has proved to be effective in discouraging deliberate tampering and has added additional functionality to the system (direct supervision no longer required).

Version 3 was an early design before V2.5 that was meant to make re-arming the mine simpler.

Version4 has all the features of V5 but is more difficult to make.

Version 5 was designed to have the tamper switch integrated into the frame, simplify the construction method, and include a buzzer to make recovery easier. This new version required a new handheld transmitter. The V2 transmitter has 6 fire action groups (up from 2) and a “chirp” mode to activate the buzzer.
